## Key Innovation: Multi-Technique Integration Algorithm

This framework combines several state-of-the-art methods into a unified algorithm:

- **Optical Flow-Based Motion Estimation**  
  Tracks object movement between consecutive video frames.

- **Adaptive Appearance Modeling**  
  Dynamically learns and updates object appearance characteristics over time.

- **Superpixel-Based Spatial Regularization**  
  Promotes spatial coherence in segmentation by aligning with image structure.

- **Multi-Scale Processing**  
  Supports robust segmentation across objects of varying sizes.

- **Deep Learning Integration** (optional)  
  Enables incorporation of pre-trained deep neural networks for enhanced performance.
